# TO-DO

## PRIORITY 1 FIXES
    - fix on edit recipe to only show ingredients not already added in the dropdown
    - fix edit on fridge, convert automatically
    - fix make recipe
    - fix add ingredients to recipes on add recipe, it works on edit
    - check make broken
    
    
## PRIORITY 2 FIXES
    - clean up css and move to different files(?) - the project breaks when I try to import css and I'm not sure why yet
    - remove attrs={'class':
    - fix DRY for the form in edit_ingredient_popup (? no idea what i meant here, check if calling form twice is optimal)
    - use exclude in the form (?)
    - add nothing to buy msg
    - make pages for records shown 
    
## FEATURES
    - add make option to grocery list
    - add category option right on the dashboards
    - add calorie tracker
    - add search boxes
    - add other units to ingredient details
    
    
## TEST
    - when deleting a category i want the ingredients to set null and display as uncategorized + add category from edit ingredients but force users to add category at form
    - add unique=true where applicable, make sure measure units are transformed dynamically
    - update the setup inscrutions and files, test on other PC and acc

    
## UI
    - fix the nav menu for mobile -> make resposnive in general
    
## EXTRA FEATURES
    - check if i can make a guide
    - check if i can make day/night widget
    - later I plan to have a check that allows edit/delete only on fields created by a specific user (user cannot delete public ingredients made by other users)
    - add weight to ingredients and recipes (total weight to be split to portions?)
    - add select boxes and select all with option to delete all ?
