I want to disclose all tools used. Special thanks to everyone, who have developed any of the below tools! 

### AI used:
  
- Vercel (v0):
  - Prototyped the UI at the start; this was the original design before major changes: [original UI](documented_files/dummy_recipe.html)


- GitHub Copilot
  - generated some coimmit messages when working on origin main from the website (ex: editing the README.md from the browser)


- ChatGPT:
  - General lazy tasks such as:
    - Look at this JSON file. Could you create more ingredients and recipes, mirroring the ones we already have?
    - I renamed my URLs to all take pk instead of recipe_id, id and so on. Could you read these views and let me know if I failed to update to pk anywhere?
    

- Claude:
  - explained to me how ajax works and showed me how to apply it to my views 
  - Assisted me with questions, such as "Do you think solution X is optimal, or should I do Y. What are the pros and cons of both approaches"
  - General lazy tasks such as:
    - I've changed my templates and styles multiple times, could you scan for any unused css classes and reorder in a more readable way?
    - Showed my DB ERD and described what I like in my app to write the text for the "how it works" section.
