edge cases and ideas:

404 - ops someone ate that if trying to access deleted record?

when deleting a category i want the ingredients to set null and display as uncategorized + add category from edit ingredients but force users to add category at form

make the nutrients so that it displays 0 only if the user input 0, otherwise it is info not available

fix the nav menu for mobile

check if i can make guide

check if i can make day/night widget

add calorie tracker

edit/fast edit (exclude nutrients)
on add ingredient add option for add more details + redirect to all nutri

make the 2026 function to take current year

come up with a better name then meal planner, some mix of grocery and recipe/track

clean up css and move to different files(?)

add unique=true where applicable, make sure measure units are transformed dynamically
