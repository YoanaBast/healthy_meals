    <h1 class="section-title">How Foodganizer Works</h1>
    <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        Foodganizer is built around one idea: <strong>you're in control</strong>. 
        Every ingredient, unit, category, and tag is yours to create and customise.
    </p>


    <!-- INGREDIENTS -->
    <section style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
        <h2 style="color: var(--accent);"> Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            Everything starts with ingredients. You can create your own ingredients from scratch —
            give them a name, category, dietary tags, and a base quantity (e.g. 100g). 
            Then fill in the full nutrient breakdown: calories, protein, carbs, fat, fibre, sugar, zinc, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each ingredient supports <strong>multiple measurement units</strong>. For example, flour can be measured 
            in grams, kilograms, or cups — and you define the conversion yourself (e.g. 1 cup = 120g). 
            This means the app can always calculate nutrients accurately no matter what unit you're using.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also create your own <strong>categories</strong> (e.g. Dairy, Grain, Vegetable), 
            <strong>dietary tags</strong> (e.g. Vegan, Gluten-Free), and <strong>measurement units</strong> 
            (e.g. cups, tablespoons, pieces) — nothing is hardcoded.
        </p>
    </section>


    <!-- RECIPES -->
    <section style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
        <h2 style="color: var(--accent);">Recipes</h2>
        <p>
            Build recipes by combining your ingredients. Each recipe tracks:
        </p>
        <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); padding-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Cooking time and servings</li>
            <li>Category (e.g. Breakfast, Dinner)</li>
            <li>Full ingredient list with quantities and units</li>
            <li>Instructions</li>
            <li>Auto-calculated total nutrients and nutrients per serving</li>
            <li>Dietary info — shared tags across all ingredients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can favourite recipes to find them quickly when generating your grocery list.

    <!-- FRIDGE -->
    <section style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
        <h2 style="color: var(--accent);">Your Fridge</h2>
        <p>
            Your fridge tracks what ingredients you currently have at home and in what quantities. 
            When you add an ingredient you already have in a different unit, Foodganizer 
            <strong>automatically converts and merges</strong> the quantities so your fridge stays accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you have 500ml of milk and add 1 cup (240ml), the app converts and 
            adds them together — no duplicates, no guesswork.
        </p>

    <!-- MEAL SUGGESTIONS -->
    <section style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
        <h2 style="color: var(--accent);">Meal Suggestions</h2>
        <p>
            Based on what's in your fridge, Foodganizer suggests which recipes you can make — 
            and shows you a <strong>match percentage</strong> so you can see how close you are even 
            if you're missing a few ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you make a recipe, the required ingredients are automatically 
            <strong>subtracted from your fridge</strong> and the meal is saved to your meal history.             Every recipe you make is logged with a timestamp. Your meal history lets you look back
            at what you've cooked and when.
        </p>

    <!-- GROCERY LIST -->
    <section style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
        <h2 style="color: var(--accent);">Grocery List</h2>
        <p>
            Select one or more recipes and generate a grocery list. Foodganizer works out exactly 
            what you need, <strong>subtracts what you already have in your fridge</strong>, and gives 
            you only the shortfall — so you never buy what you don't need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you've done your shopping, you can add individual items or your entire grocery list 
            to your fridge in one click. Your generation history is also saved so you can review 
            past lists.
