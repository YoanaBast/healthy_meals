The Foodganizer is built around one idea: you're in control. Every recipe, ingredient, unit, category, and tag is yours to create and customise. Fill your digital fridge and get meal suggestions that won't send you to the store! Or if you feel like going out, geenrate a grocery list fast and easy from recipes of your choice! 

If you hate the cognitive load that comes with planning meals every single day - this app is for you!

## 🛠 Installation

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.11+  
- Local PostgreSQL Database


### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YoanaBast/healthy_meals.git
cd healthy_meals
```
- healthy_meals is the name of my root, if you set another name for yours, please use that name - cd your_root
- if you already have a root with venv and clone in that venv, you may get the healthy_meals folder nested in your root. Then you need to cd healthy_meals

  
### 2. Virtual Environment
**Check if a venv already exists:**
- If you created a project in your IDE, it may have already created a virtual environment.
- Look in the project folder for a `venv/` (or similarly named) directory.  
- You can also check the IDE’s Python interpreter settings to see if a venv is active.

**If no venv exists, create one:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # on Windows
```

- all following commands are to be run in the root where manage.py is (healthy_meals or your_root)
  

### 3. Setup

#### 3.1 Fast Setup
You can run the command below to complete the setup:
```bash
python fast_setup.py
```
- This will do the following:
  - create .env if you don't have one (you need to put your creds like [this](docs/creds_example.md))
  - install requirements
  - makemigrations and migrate
  - collectstatic

#### 3.2 Manual Setup
If you don't want to use the fast setup, you can follow the steps below
  - create a .env file in the root directory (healthy_meals or the name you set locally)
  - put [this](docs/creds_example.md) inside and update it with your credentials
  - run this to install requirements:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  - run this to set up your DB:
```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
```
  - run this to set up the css:
```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### 4. Server
- You can now run the server to see the app:
```bash
    python manage.py runserver
```
- Stop the server with CRL + C in the same console
- If you are reloading collectstatic for some reason, you need to re-run the surver (stop and run again)

### 5. Dummy Data
- You can populate the DB with some dummy data by running this:
```bash
    python manage.py populate_dummy_data
```

## Notes:
1. This is developed as uni assignment. To be compliant to the no auth requirement, I have assigned a default user for all logic that needs it. I intend to scale the app and a huge part of my logic will depend on dynamic users. 
   - default user in question: user = get_object_or_404(User, username="default")
   - No auth requirement: "Authentication and Django User management are explicitly excluded from the following requirements. You are not supposed to implement login, logout, registration, or user-related functionality."

2. The project uses WhiteNoise to serve static files because DEBUG=False. Without it, collectstatic doesn’t serve files correctly. DEBUG=False is required for the custom 404 page.
